# Datawrangling

## Data Sources Used 
The project majorly requires the following dataset:
-	Bird Count by Species over the Years for different Countries
-	Climate Change and Pollution related Dataset such as:
-	World Temperature
- CO2 Emission
-	Human Population Density 

## Bird Dataset 
To understand the trend worldwide or per country regarding the bird species counts, if it is actually stable or declining or increasing, a single reliable database that keeps updating the birds spotted information is required. The Cornell Lab is a significant contributor in the field of Ornithology and hence dataset gathered from their organization is a rightful choice.

## Pollution Dataset 
Climate change is primarily an issue due to air pollution. The pollution is measured by looking at the CO2 emission rate of countries all around the globe. A long and historical estimate of annual carbon dioxide emissions was needed. This data set for Carbon-di-oxide emissions are obtained from Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Centre (CDIAC; Marland et al,2004).

## Intended Use of the Dataset
Using the dataset wrangled possible research ideas include the following.
- Does the extinction rate or loss of bird count depend on population rate, pollution rate, global warming?
- Establish migratory bird patterns over the year across country
- Variation in migratory patterns over the years due to above factors
- Regional bird count variations in case of indigenous species
- Plotting the CO2 emission since 1940 to find top 10 influencing countries
