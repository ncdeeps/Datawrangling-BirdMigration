,a Range of emissions estimates predicted by Monte Carlo Stochastic Simulation for a 95 percent confidence interval.,,,,,,
,b Note that the relative uncertainty range was estimated with respect to the 2001 emission estimates from the 2003 submission and applied to the 2017 estimates.,,,,,,
,"c The overall uncertainty calculated in 2003, and applied to the 2017 emission estimate, did not include uncertainty estimates for calves, American bison, and mules and asses. Additionally, for bulls the emissions estimate was based on the Tier 1 methodology. Since bull emissions are now estimated using the Tier 2 method, the uncertainty surrounding their estimates is likely lower than indicated by the previous uncertainty analysis.",,,,,,
